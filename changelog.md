## v2.0

**IMPORTANT: This is a completely new module from a new developer. You will have to manually uninstall the old version that you are updating. You should also read the [README](https://github.com/sean6541/op9_series_camera_unlocker) for this new module. It contains important information regarding it's functionality and how to use it. This new module's repo is at: [https://github.com/sean6541/op9_series_camera_unlocker](https://github.com/sean6541/op9_series_camera_unlocker)**

#### If Your Updating From Camera Unlocker v1.x:

- If you have the "Full Resolution Unlocker" module installed, you must remove it. This module includes all of it's functionality and will interfere with it.
- Completely revamped logic that removes the need for a firmware selector or device selector. Should work on all versions of OOS and any custom ROMs using OOS vendor FW.
- Added unlockers for aux cameras and full resolution (48MP main and 50MP ultrawide) RAW. See "How To Use Full Resolution" below.

#### If Your Updating From Any Version Of Full Resolution Unlocker:

- If you have the old "Camera Unlocker" module installed, you must remove it.
- Added unlockers for aux cameras and face detection.
- Create app that creates a quick settings tile for toggling full resolution. See below for more info.

#### How To Use Full Resolution:

- Download and install my custom app: [FullResToggle.apk](https://github.com/sean6541/op9_series_camera_unlocker/releases/download/v2.0/FullResToggle.apk). This app will not show up anywhere, all it does is create a quick settings tile labeled "Full Resolution". Add this new tile to your quick settings. Tap it to enable/disable full resolution. Wait approximately 10 seconds after toggling it before opening any camera apps.
